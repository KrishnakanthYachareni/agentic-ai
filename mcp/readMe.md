## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**What it's not:**
1. A framework for building agents
2. A fundamental change to how agents work
3. A way to code agents

**What it is:**
1. A protocol - a standard
2. A simple way to integrate tools, resoruces, prompts
3. "A USB-C port for AI applications"

**Reasons not to be excited**
1. It's just a standard, it's not tools themselves
2. LangChain already has big Tools ecosystem
3. You can already make any function into a Tool

**Reasone to be excited**
1. Makes it frictionless to integrate
2. It's taking off! Exploding ecosystem
3. HTML was just a standard, too.

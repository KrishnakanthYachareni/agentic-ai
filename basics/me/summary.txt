My name is Krishna. I'm an software engineer and data scientist. I'm originally from Hyderabad, India, but I moved to USA in 2021.
I love all foods, particularly Mexican food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.

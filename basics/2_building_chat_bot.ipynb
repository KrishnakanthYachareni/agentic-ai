I'm originally from Hyderabad, India, but I moved to USA in 2021.\\nI love all foods, particularly Mexican food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.\\n\\n## LinkedIn Profile:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nContact\\n430 Buckingham Rd, Richardson,\\nTexas 75081\\n+16019132820 (Mobile)\\nyacharenikrishnakanth@gmail\\n.com\\nwww.linkedin.com/in/\\nyacharenikrishnakanth (LinkedIn)\\nkrishnakanthyachareni.github.io/\\npersonal-website/ (Portfolio)\\nsites.google.com/site/\\nkrishnakanthychareni/home\\n(Personal)\\ncode2getday.blogspot.com/ (Blog)\\nTop Skills\\nEngineering\\nJava Development\\nMicrosoft Azure\\nLanguages\\nTelugu (Native or Bilingual)\\nEnglish (Full Professional)\\nHindi (Elementary)\\nCertifications\\nReact.js: Building an Interface\\nIntro to Python for Data Science\\nMastering Microservices with Java\\nDatabase in the Cloud\\nAngular Essential Training\\nHonors-Awards\\nBest Software Engineer-Award\\nGraduate Research Assistant\\nKrishnakanth Yachareni\\nSenior Software Engineer @ Walmart | AI | Machine Learning\\n| Design Scalable & Reliable Systems | DSA | Competitive\\nProgrammer\\nRichardson, Texas, United States\\nSummary\\n• Highly motivated and experienced Software Engineer with a\\nstrong background in developing and delivering high-quality, reliable\\nsoftware solutions. \\n• 5+ years of commendable experience in developing enterprise\\napplications using Java/J2EE in Agile and Scaled Agile\\nmethodology.\\n• Proven track record of delivering successful projects on time and\\nwithin budget. \\n• Strong problem-solving skills and ability to work well in a team\\nenvironment.\\n• Passionate about staying current with industry trends and\\ntechnology advancements to deliver high- quality, reliable software. \\n• Seeking to leverage my skills and experience to make a positive\\nimpact at a dynamic and innovative company.\\n• Good experience in developing RESTful web services using Spring\\nBoot, and Microservices.\\n• Can develop an efficient event-driven based API using an\\nasynchronous messaging system.\\n• Able to design, and implement the highly scalable, available\\nsystem.\\n• Hands-on experience in designing and developing dynamic HTML\\npages using Angular.\\n• Key business domain banking/finance.\\n• Key members involved in the integration of gateway with global\\npayment gateways such as  NPCI (RuPay), PayPal, MADA,\\nFirstData, 3DS Authentication, Accertify(Interceptas) Risk\\nmanagement.\\n• Involved in the complete software development lifecycle, including\\ndesign, development, deployment, and automation testing of the\\napplication.\\n• Ability to handle multiple tasks independently and in a team.\\n\\xa0 Page 1 of 7\\xa0 \\xa0\\n• An effective communicator with excellent interpersonal, logical\\nthinking & analytical abilities.\\nSKILLS/INTERESTS:\\n➢ Languages: Java, Python, JavaScript(ES6), TypeScript, R-\\nProgramming, SQL.\\n➢ Spring framework: Spring Boot, Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring\\nAOP, Spring ORM, Security, Spring \\nREST/SOAP\\n➢ Back-end: JavaEE, Microservices, RESTFul, GraphQL, Node.js,\\nExpress.js, Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Nchan messaging, \\nAWS \\n(EC2, S3, Cloud Front, Redis), GCP\\n➢ Frond-end: Angular 8+, React.js, Redux, HTML5, CSS3,\\nBootStrap, Velocity.\\n➢ DataBase: Oracle, MySQL, Cassandra, MongoDB\\n➢ Automation Testing: Selenium, Cucumber, Apache Jmeter,\\nJenkins.\\n➢ Frameworks & Tools: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Maven, Gradle,\\nJunit, Spock, Mockito, Jasmine, \\nKarma, Power Mockito.\\n➢ Machine Learning: Python, Deep Learning, CNN, Tensorflow,\\nKeras, OpenCV\\nExperience\\nWalmart Global Tech\\n2 years 6 months\\nSenior Software Engineer\\nJanuary 2025\\xa0-\\xa0Present\\xa0(6 months)\\nDallas, Texas, United States\\nSoftware Engineer III\\nJanuary 2023\\xa0-\\xa0December 2024\\xa0(2 years)\\nDallas, Texas, United States\\n1.
